GoogleNet is a pretrained neural network we will be scalling to fit our own project. 

In the GoogleLet File input an image to see what the most obvious label is in the image

Moving onto the model file, we scaled it to train on an entire image folder. We are playing around with the specs of the neural network to fit an output that shows if a user is attentive.
